We Hospice provides quality care through a team approach and offers a means to achieve what people say they really want at the end of life:

***We provide the FOUR LEVELS OF CARE***
There are four levels of hospice care defined by law and paid for by Medicare, Medicaid, and most other insurance plans. Hospice care is available regardless of the patient’s geographical location, and keeps patients in the setting that best meets their needs, wherever they may reside.


ROUTINE CARE:  The patient receives hospice services at home or in a home-like setting, such as nursing home, assisted living facility or a hospice residential facility. The family provides the primary care to the patient with the assistance of the hospice team.

CONTINUOUS CARE: Skilled nursing services that are provided in the patient’s place of residence to help during a crisis period.

INPATIENT CARE: This care is provided in a facility (hospital, nursing facility, or hospice freestanding inpatient facility) for symptoms or a crisis that cannot be managed in the patient’s residence. Inpatient care is provided for a limited period of time, as determined by the physician and the hospice team.

RESPITE CARE: This service is provided in a facility (hospital, nursing facility, or hospice freestanding inpatient facility) and is designed to give caregivers a rest. Respite care is up to five days and nights at a time. This service is often used to provide a break so that caregivers can participate in other family activities, such as holiday celebrations, or just to relieve a tired caregiver for a few days.
